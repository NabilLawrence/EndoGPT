"The size of the cervical esophagus pre and post myotomy was 3.8 ± 0.57 cm and 3.0 ± 0.37 cm respectively (P < 0.001).  conclude that myotomy for achalasia is associated with a significant decrease in the esophageal volume and pressure which is probably due to altered morphology of esophageal wall., The significance of increased size of the esophageal wall following myotomy was demonstrated by the findings of a significantly lower esophageal and lower pulse pressure suggesting decreased distensibility following myotomy.",0
